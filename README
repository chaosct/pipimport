Pipimport automatically installs missing modules using pip at import time.
It is best used with virtualenv.

Just import pipimport and call install():

>>> import pipimport
>>> pipimport.install()

Now you can normally import modules that are not currently installed.
Pipimport will call pip (form your virtualenv) and install it before importing.

>>> import unipath
Will install module unipath
Downloading/unpacking unipath
  Downloading Unipath-1.0.tar.gz
  Running setup.py egg_info for package unipath  
Installing collected packages: unipath
  Running setup.py install for unipath
Successfully installed unipath
Cleaning up...
>>> unipath
<module 'unipath' from '/home/carles/Projectes/piphook/ve/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/unipath/__init__.pyc'>

The modules that can't be found are remembered so sequential imports don't try to
download them again. This list is saved in the virtualenv directory ( sys.prefix )
or in the working directory (the first with writing permissions) with the name
of .pipimport-ignore . The list is loaded in subsequent sessions.
